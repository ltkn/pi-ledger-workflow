# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `workflow-help.md`: day-to-day guide for the normal path and edge cases (stuck tasks, stalls, replanning, undo, review findings)
- Situational **What now** block after every scope, plan, build and review result, taken from `workflow-help.md`
- `/wf:help [topic]` posts a guide section into the session
- Fix: answering an attempt-limit pause with `/wf:build <guidance>` now resets the task's attempts (it used to re-ask immediately); plain `/wf:build` prompts for the answer

## 0.1.0

- `/wf:scope`, `/wf:plan`, `/wf:build`, `/wf:review`, `/wf:status`
- Fresh-context manager/worker loop over an on-disk ledger (`.pi/wf/`), test suite as ground truth
- Build-time questions (`questions: "ask" | "assume"`), inline answers, `/wf:build <answer|guidance>`
- Guards: round budget, per-task attempt limit, no-progress stop, cut-off summarizer, capped plan/notes
- Independent review without worker notes; review follow-ups become R-tasks
