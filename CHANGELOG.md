# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- `/wf:scope`, `/wf:plan`, `/wf:build`, `/wf:review`, `/wf:status`
- Fresh-context manager/worker loop over an on-disk ledger (`.pi/wf/`), test suite as ground truth
- Build-time questions (`questions: "ask" | "assume"`), inline answers, `/wf:build <answer|guidance>`
- Guards: round budget, per-task attempt limit, no-progress stop, cut-off summarizer, capped plan/notes
- Independent review without worker notes; review follow-ups become R-tasks
